# Serverless Github Check
Serverless Github Check. This repo is part of the [Serverless November Challengue](https://serverless.com/blog/no-server-november-challenge/)

The idea is to validate that all Pull Requests are related to a specific trello card.

Check rules:

* To pass the check, the Pull Request body should start with: "Related trello card: https://trello.com/"
